# Communicate using Markdown

Welcome to my Markdown practice file 👋  
This file is created as part of the GitHub course **Communicate using Markdown**.

## About This File

I am learning how to use Markdown to:
- Structure content clearly
- Communicate better on GitHub
- Write readable issues and pull requests

## Step 1: Headers

In Step 1, I learned how to:
- Create headers using `#`
- Use different header levels
- Organize content logically

## Step 2: Add an Image

Below is an example of adding an image using Markdown with alt text.

The image above includes descriptive alt-text to support accessibility.

## Next Steps

I will continue learning how to:
- Add code blocks
- Create task lists
- Use Markdown effectively on GitHub
## Step 3: Add a Code Example

Below is a simple code block example

```bash
git init
```
