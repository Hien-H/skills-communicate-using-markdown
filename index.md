# Communicate using Markdown

Welcome to my Markdown practice file 👋  
This file is part of the GitHub course **Communicate using Markdown**.

## About Me

I am learning how to use Markdown to:
- Organize ideas
- Communicate clearly on GitHub
- Write better issues and pull requests

## What I Learned in Step 1

- How to create headers using `#`
- That Markdown supports 6 header levels
- Headers help structure content clearly

### Header Levels Example

#### This is a level 4 header
##### This is a level 5 header
###### This is a level 6 header

## Next Steps

I will continue the course and learn how to:
